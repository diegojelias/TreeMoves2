To Do:



readTree.py
	- make multiple ways to pick starting node. Currently relies on an exponential distribution to preferentially make moves on shorter branches. 
	- Do we need to store branch lengths? If processing time becomes an issue then delete these steps. 
	- Use characters to illustrate what the moves are doing. Lable with variables from code. 
		- >>> tree = Phylo.parse('phyloxml_examples.xml', 'phyloxml').next()
		- >>> Phylo.draw_ascii(tree)
	- write Tree function to output number of tips
	"""
		def num_tips(self,node,counter=0):
		"""
		A method of a Tree object that will print out the number of terminal nodes. Pass the root as an argument.
		"""
		if node.children == []: #Identifies terminal node
			counter+=1
			return counter
		else:
			for child in node.children:
				self.num_tips(child,counter)
